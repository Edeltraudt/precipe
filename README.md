Collaborative cookbook and meal planner with not-yet-fully defined requirements.

## Use Case

In larger groups, it may get hard to track food intolerances, allergies, and other dietary restrictions, making it more difficult to plan for a meal. This app intends to ease that process by providing a cookbook that can be shared with groups, where each group member can state their preferences.

## Design Drafts
Need review depending on the requirement status
